								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p>Hi, I am Abrar Fahim an Electrical Engineering graduate currently working at Z-Band Technologies,LLC 
								
								</p>
	
								<p> About myself I would say from a very early age, I was fascinated by how things work, especially toys and robots.Playing with those toys was fun but for me  
									 the real fun would always start after the toys were broken because then I could dissect the electro-mechanical parts like motors and actuators. 
									From those scraps, I would make some new kinds of toys. This sort of small accomplishment somewhat made me feel like a mad scientist developing his mad creations.
								</p>
								<p>I think my early age passion for developing things from scraps ignited my dream of becoming an Electrical Engineer. So after my high school studies 
									I was admitted to North South University, a reputed university in Bangladesh and consequently getting my Masters in Electrical Engineering Degree from New York University.
									During both level of my academic journey I got in touch with the glipses of engineering which turned in to real life scenerios when I joined at Z-Band Technologies,LLC.
									At Z-band I have the opportunity to work with a bunch of brilliant minds in different sectors. Where all of us push forward to create better video distribution products for better connected future.   
								</p>
								<p> 
									In my personal life I am married to a beautiful and aspiring dentist who always cheers and pushes me to improve myself as an engineer for a better tomorrow.
