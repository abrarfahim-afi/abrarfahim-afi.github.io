								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p>Hi, I am Abrar Fahim, a final semester grad student pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering at 
									New York University, Tandon School of Engineering.
								</p>
	
								<p>From a very early age, I was fascinated by how things work, especially toys and robots.Playing with those toys was fun but for me  
									 the real fun would always start after the toys were broken because then I could dissect the electro-mechanical parts like motors and actuators. 
									From those scraps, I would make some new kinds of toys. This sort of small accomplishment somewhat made me feel like a mad scientist developing his mad creations.
								</p>
								<p>I think my early age passion for developing things from scraps ignited my dream of becoming an Electrical and Electronic Engineer. So after my high school studies 
									I was admitted to North South University, a reputed university in Bangladesh. Where I got in touch with real engineering.
									As an undergraduate student, my tenure at North South University exposed me to fascinating courses and well-equipped lab facilities. 
									During my undergrad, I also discovered my hidden passion for teaching. Therefore, I worked as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in my department during my undergrad years.
									And after my graduation, I joined the same department as a part-time Lab Officer. 
								   I taught and demonstrated lab experiments for analog electronics, Control Systems, and c programming language. During my tenure as Lab Officer, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
									As a result, academia had to change the teaching paradigm. At that time, I had to formulate new and innovative teaching methods to catch my student's attention and make the online class as lively as possible.	
								</p>
								<p>As the human thirst for knowledge is never-ending and should be quenched as early as possible, I had to leave my job as a Lab officer and join NYU Tandon School of Engineering for my graduate studies.
                                    I started my grad journey in the Fall of 2021. From the beginning till this day, the faculties and student community never failed to amaze me. Studying here at NYU gave me a perspective on cutting-edge research and generated a love for networking & hardware engineering.
                                    Therefore, with my school's help, I could equip myself with the knowledge of Internet Architecture and Protocol, Wireless Network Security, Real-Time Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, Analog Integrated Circuits, and VLSI System Design.
                                    But I believe any engineering knowledge remains half unless it receives industry experience. Therefore, I aim to join the industry and solidify the knowledge that I have gained.
