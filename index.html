								</header>
								<p class="content">Abstract: Parking allocation has become a major problem in modern cities for which numerous smart parking systems (SPS) have been developed. This paper aims to provide comprehensive study, comparison and extensive analysis of SPSs in terms of technological approach, sensors utilized, networking technologies, user interface, computational approaches, and service provided. Moreover, the paper fills up the research gap by providing a clear insight into the suitability of SPSs in various environmental conditions and highlights their advantages/disadvantages. The extensive comparison among multiple aspects of SPSs would enable researchers, designers, and policymakers to identify the best suited SPS and understand the current trends in this sector.</p>

								<p class="content">Abstract:
									The countries of South East Asia are going through a rapid growth in the economy over the last decade. Much of this economic development is fueled by the development of their power generation. Unfortunately, transformer theft is a common scenario in these countries, which is a key impediment in the way of advancement in the power sector. Therefore, to solve this problem, a GSM based transformer theft protection and monitoring system has been developed in order to protect the distribution transformers from thieves. In addition, the system can also monitor the health parameters of a transformer. The system developed in this paper utilizes several sensors such as a magnetic sensor, IR sensors and weight sensors in order to detect nearby person who wants to steal or vandalize the transformer by notifying the incident to the authority via SMS service of the GSM technology. Moreover, the authority can also monitor transformer health parameters such as transformer temperature and oil level.</p>

								<p class="content">Abstract:
								In recent years, circuit design of high-frequency active quasi-circulator for full-duplex wireless systems have attracted wide attention in the area of Microwave and Radio Frequency (RF) circuits. This paper presents the design of an active quasi-circulator intended for operation in the 60 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radio band, employing 22nm FD-SOI technology. The goal is to achieve a low noise figure, superior isolation, and a high-power handling capability, as measured by the 1 dB compression point.
								The quasi-circulator design incorporates a Wilkinson power divider and low noise amplifier, yielding a noise figure of 7 dB, 18 dBm power handling, 20 dB isolation, and 2.08 mW power consumption.

								The embedded memory of a system is tested using various sets
								of algorithms to detect different types of faults that may reside
								inside of memory, such as Stuck At Fault (SAF), Transitional
								Delay Fault (TDF), Coupling Fault (CF), Neighbourhood Pattern
								Sensitive Faults (NPSF). Since the method is self-testing, a single

							<p><b>A Noble Approach To Detect Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) And Monitor Environmental Parameters</b><br>
							Abrar Fahim
							</p>
							<p class="content">
								Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sometimes known as "Cot death," is a pediatric phenomenon seen in infants less than a year old. Where unexpected death happens to a healthy-looking baby, usually during its sleep. 
								According to the National Health Services of the United Kingdom, around 200 babies die yearly from SIDS. 
								Although the number might seem alarming, the cases are rare. 
								So, not much emphasis is given to its prevention or detection.
								In this project, we have developed a microcontroller-based solution that could monitor a baby's vitals and alarm the parents if there is an anomaly in the vital of the child or the surrounding environment.

									<p><b>Junior Design Project: Sun Light Tracking Solar Panel with Real-Time Power Logger</b><br>
										Abrar Fahim, Nuren Shams, Md.Rofiqul Islam
									</p>
									<p class="content">
										In the modern world of science and technology renewable and green energy is a buzz word that
										seems to be uttered constantly. One of the key source of renewable energy comes from harnessing
										the solar energy from the Sun light. For harnessing solar energy we use solar panels. Most of these
										solar panels that we used are mounted at a fixed angle. For this type of non-moveable solar panels
										the user can harness solar energy form the sun at a fixed period of day time . So, rest of the solar
										energy gets wasted. Thus, keeping this problem in mind we have designed a solution to this energy
										wastage problem. The solution of this problem is a rotating solar panel module that follows the sun
										light through the day using LDRs ( Light Dependent Resistor ) and servo motor as the feedback
										system, which rotates the module in a vertical and a horizontal direction. In this project we have
										impelled that solution and also added a measurement device with it which measures the voltage
										current and also the power delivered by the solar panel to a particular object.
